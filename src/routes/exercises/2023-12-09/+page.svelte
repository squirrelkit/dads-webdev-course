<p class="flex justify-center">I have gotten started with skeleton and tailwind and I am very, very excited.
    
    Just tried making a commit from the source control right here in vscode. If you go to vscode you'll see in the left sidebar, the third icon. You can commit from there. (I think. Not certain if it worked.)
    
    Ok on checking.... It didn't work. idk why it didn't work.
